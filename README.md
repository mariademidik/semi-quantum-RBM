# semi-quantum-RBM
This repository contains the code for the paper "Expressive Equivalence of Classical and Quantum Restricted Boltzmann Machines." The implementation includes scripts for training and evaluating both classical and quantum Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs).

[train.jl](./train.jl): to train model of interest (see the script for details)
[compute_gradients.jl](./compute_gradients.jl): to batch compute the gradients of models
